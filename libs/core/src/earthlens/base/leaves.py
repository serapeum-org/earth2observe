class SummarisedLeaf(BaseModel):
    """Catalog row that prints as one readable line instead of a field dump.

    A catalog row is normally read for three things — what it is called,
    what units it is in, and how big or how recent it is. Pydantic's default
    `__str__` answers none of them quickly: it prints every field, including
    the `None`s.

    `None`, empty strings and empty collections are skipped, so a sparse row
    stays short; a non-empty collection renders as a count (`12 bands`).
    Fragments are capped at `MAX_FRAGMENT` characters and the joined summary
    at `MAX_SUMMARY`, both marked with an ellipsis when cut. A subclass
    needing a different shape overrides `summary_parts`.

    Only `__str__` is defined. `__repr__` is deliberately left as pydantic's
    field-complete form: that is the debugging contract, and doctests and log
    lines can depend on its exact text.

    Examples:
        - Declare the fields worth showing, in order, then print a row:
            ```python
            >>> class Dataset(SummarisedLeaf):
            ...     _summary_fields = ("id", "title", "bands")
            ...     id: str
            ...     title: str | None = None
            ...     bands: dict[str, int] = {}
            >>> print(Dataset(id="A/B", title="A title", bands={"b1": 1}))
            Dataset(A/B, A title, 1 band)

            ```
        - A sparse row stays short instead of printing `None` placeholders:
            ```python
            >>> class Dataset(SummarisedLeaf):
            ...     _summary_fields = ("id", "title")
            ...     id: str
            ...     title: str | None = None
            >>> print(Dataset(id="A/B"))
            Dataset(A/B)

            ```
        - `__repr__` still carries every field, so debugging is unaffected:
            ```python
            >>> class Dataset(SummarisedLeaf):
            ...     _summary_fields = ("id",)
            ...     id: str
            ...     title: str | None = None
            >>> row = Dataset(id="A/B")
            >>> str(row)
            'Dataset(A/B)'
            >>> repr(row)
            "Dataset(id='A/B', title=None)"
